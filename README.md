Project Description: Rice Grain Quality Detection Model
Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically assess the quality of rice grains based on images. The model will classify rice grains as either "affected" or "not affected," facilitating quality control in agricultural practices and supply chains.

Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 100 images of rice grains. Each image is labeled as either "affected" or "not affected," providing a clear distinction for the model to learn from. The labels are stored in an Excel sheet, associating each image with its respective quality status.

Model Architecture:

The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.
Key components of the CNN architecture include multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, activation functions (such as ReLU) for introducing non-linearity, pooling layers for down-sampling, and fully connected layers for classification.
Training Process:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
During training, the model learns to identify features that distinguish affected grains from unaffected ones, such as color variations, surface textures, and other visual cues.
The model is optimized using techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent, with a focus on minimizing a loss function that quantifies the difference between predicted and actual labels.
Evaluation Metrics:

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
A confusion matrix is utilized to visualize the model's predictions, highlighting true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Deployment: Once trained and validated, the model can be converted to TensorFlow Lite format for deployment on mobile devices, allowing users to take photos of rice grains and receive instant quality assessments.

Applications: This model has potential applications in agricultural quality control, rice processing facilities, and consumer markets, where ensuring the quality of rice products is crucial for both safety and consumer satisfaction.

Future Improvements: Future enhancements could involve expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of rice grains, integrating additional features such as moisture content analysis, or employing transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models for improved accuracy.
